We want to build a small representation of a Garage in Java. This Garage should be able to
store different types of Vehicles. Every Vehicle has a weight in kilograms (int). There are a
few specific types of vehicles such as:
• Cars, which also have a color.
• Trucks, which have a load capacity in kilograms (int).
• Electric Cars, which are a special type of Car and also have a battery capacity in
kilowatt-hours (int).
In the main method, we want to:
1. Create an instance of the Garage.
2. Add various kinds of vehicles to it.
3. Print:
o The total number of vehicles in the garage.
o The number of Electric Cars specifically.
