Generated on: 2026-02-15 14:59:14

============================================================ PART 1: AWS
ROUTE 53 – ADVANCED QUESTIONS
============================================================

1)  How does Route 53 ensure high availability? Answer: Route 53 is a
    globally distributed DNS service. It uses Anycast routing to direct
    DNS queries to the nearest healthy DNS server. Health checks
    continuously monitor endpoints and automatically reroute traffic if
    a failure is detected.

2)  Explain different routing policies and when to use them. Answer:

-   Simple: Single resource, no health checks.
-   Weighted: Split traffic based on assigned weights (useful for A/B
    testing).
-   Latency-based: Routes traffic to the lowest latency region.
-   Failover: Active-passive setup using health checks.
-   Geolocation: Routes based on user’s geographic location.
-   Geoproximity: Routes based on user location with bias control.
-   Multivalue Answer: Returns multiple healthy IPs.

3)  Difference between Geolocation and Geoproximity routing? Answer:
    Geolocation is strictly based on user location (continent/country).
    Geoproximity allows bias adjustment to shift traffic toward a
    specific region.

4)  How do Route 53 health checks work internally? Answer: Route 53
    health checks send HTTP/HTTPS/TCP requests from multiple global
    locations. If the threshold of failed checks is crossed, the
    endpoint is marked unhealthy.

5)  Can Route 53 be used for private DNS? Answer: Yes. Using Private
    Hosted Zones inside a VPC, Route 53 resolves internal domain names.

6)  How does Route 53 support disaster recovery? Answer: Using failover
    routing, health checks, and multi-region deployments with
    active-active or active-passive configurations.

CLOUDFRONT – ADVANCED QUESTIONS
============================================================

7)  What is CloudFront and how does it work internally? Answer:
    CloudFront is a CDN. It caches content at edge locations globally.
    When a request comes:

-   If cached → served from edge.
-   If not cached → fetched from origin (S3, EC2, ALB, etc.), cached,
    then returned.

8)  What is Origin Shield? Answer: Origin Shield is an additional
    caching layer that reduces load on origin by centralizing cache
    misses through a regional shield location.

9)  Explain CloudFront cache key. Answer: Cache key determines what
    makes a request unique. It can include:

-   URL path
-   Query strings
-   Headers
-   Cookies

Improper cache key configuration can reduce cache hit ratio.

10) How do you invalidate CloudFront cache? Answer: Using invalidation
    requests or versioned object naming (recommended).

11) Difference between S3 static website endpoint and S3 REST endpoint
    with CloudFront? Answer:

-   Static website endpoint supports redirects and index documents.
-   REST endpoint supports OAI/OAC for private access. Best practice:
    Use REST endpoint + OAC.

12) What is OAI vs OAC? Answer: OAI (Origin Access Identity) is legacy.
    OAC (Origin Access Control) is modern and supports enhanced security
    features.

13) How does CloudFront protect against DDoS? Answer: Integrated with
    AWS Shield (Standard by default) and AWS WAF for advanced filtering.

14) Explain Lambda@Edge vs CloudFront Functions. Answer: Lambda@Edge:

-   Runs at edge locations.
-   Supports complex logic.
-   Higher latency and cost.

CloudFront Functions: - Lightweight. - Ultra-low latency. - Limited
runtime capabilities.

15) How would you design a low-latency global application using Route 53
    and CloudFront? Answer:

-   Use Route 53 latency-based routing across regions.
-   Deploy app in multiple regions.
-   Use CloudFront with multiple origins.
-   Enable health checks and automatic failover.
-   Use WAF and Shield for protection.

SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS
============================================================

16) Users from India are getting high latency. How do you troubleshoot?
    Answer:

-   Check Route 53 routing policy.
-   Verify CloudFront edge location usage.
-   Check origin region distance.
-   Analyze CloudFront cache hit ratio.
-   Review network performance metrics.

17) Your CloudFront cache hit ratio dropped suddenly. Possible reasons?
    Answer:

-   Cache key misconfiguration.
-   Increased query string variability.
-   Short TTL.
-   Frequent invalidations.

18) How would you secure private content in CloudFront? Answer:

-   Use Signed URLs or Signed Cookies.
-   Use OAC with S3.
-   Restrict bucket policy.
-   Enable HTTPS only.
