AWS ROUTE 53 & CLOUDFRONT – ADVANCED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS

============================ AWS ROUTE 53 – DIFFICULT Q&A
============================

1)  Explain how Route 53 latency-based routing works internally. Answer:
    Latency-based routing routes traffic to the region with the lowest
    network latency for the user. It uses AWS health and latency
    measurements between edge locations and AWS regions. Route 53 does
    not measure real-time user latency; it relies on historical AWS
    network data.

2)  Difference between Failover routing and Multi-Value Answer routing?
    Answer: Failover Routing:

-   Active-Passive model
-   Uses health checks
-   If primary fails, traffic shifts to secondary

Multi-Value Answer Routing: - Returns multiple healthy records - Works
like simple DNS load balancing - Removes unhealthy records automatically

3)  How does Route 53 health check work for private resources? Answer:
    For private VPC resources, Route 53 cannot directly check private
    IPs. Solution:

-   Use CloudWatch alarm health checks
-   Or use Route 53 health checker inside VPC via Lambda

4)  What is DNS TTL impact in production outages? Answer: TTL determines
    how long DNS is cached.

-   Low TTL → Faster failover but higher DNS query cost
-   High TTL → Slower failover but reduced cost Production systems often
    use 30–60 seconds TTL for critical systems.

5)  Explain weighted routing with example use case. Answer: Weighted
    routing splits traffic by percentage. Example:

-   Version A → 80%
-   Version B → 20% Used for canary deployments and A/B testing.

6)  How does Route 53 support hybrid DNS architecture? Answer: Using:

-   Route 53 Resolver
-   Inbound endpoints
-   Outbound endpoints Allows on-prem DNS to resolve AWS private hosted
    zones.

7)  Difference between Alias record and CNAME? Answer: Alias:

-   AWS-specific
-   Works at root domain
-   No extra cost
-   Points to AWS resources

CNAME: - Standard DNS record - Cannot be used at root domain - Adds
extra DNS lookup

=============================== AWS CLOUDFRONT – DIFFICULT Q&A
===============================

1)  Explain CloudFront caching mechanism in detail. Answer: CloudFront
    caches content at edge locations. Cache key includes:

-   URL path
-   Query string
-   Headers
-   Cookies Cache behavior defines TTL, origin, and caching policy.

2)  What is the difference between Origin Shield and Regional Edge
    Cache? Answer: Regional Edge Cache:

-   Intermediate caching layer
-   Reduces load on origin

Origin Shield: - Additional centralized caching layer - Reduces origin
requests even further - Helps during traffic spikes

3)  How does CloudFront handle dynamic content? Answer:

-   Forward headers/cookies/query strings
-   Disable caching or set low TTL
-   Use Lambda@Edge for customization

4)  Explain Signed URLs vs Signed Cookies. Answer: Signed URL:

-   Grants access to single file

Signed Cookie: - Grants access to multiple files Used in private content
delivery.

5)  How does CloudFront integrate with WAF? Answer: AWS WAF attaches to
    CloudFront distribution. It filters traffic before reaching origin.
    Used for:

-   IP blocking
-   Rate limiting
-   SQL injection protection

6)  What is Field-Level Encryption? Answer: Encrypts specific HTTP
    fields at edge. Only backend application can decrypt. Used for
    sensitive data like PII.

7)  How do you invalidate CloudFront cache? Answer:

-   Create invalidation request
-   Path-based (e.g., /images/*) Note: Frequent invalidations increase
    cost.

8)  How does CloudFront support high availability? Answer:

-   Multiple edge locations globally
-   Origin failover configuration
-   Integration with Route 53 failover

9)  Explain OAI vs OAC in CloudFront. Answer: OAI (Origin Access
    Identity):

-   Older mechanism
-   Used for S3 private access

OAC (Origin Access Control): - Newer - Supports advanced signing
(SigV4) - Recommended approach

10) How to reduce CloudFront cost in high traffic systems? Answer:

-   Optimize TTL
-   Use compression (Gzip/Brotli)
-   Avoid unnecessary invalidations
-   Use proper cache key configuration
-   Enable Origin Shield

================================== SCENARIO-BASED ARCHITECTURE QUESTIONS
==================================

1)  Design highly available global web application using Route 53 and
    CloudFront. Answer:

-   Route 53 latency-based routing
-   CloudFront CDN
-   Multi-region ALB + Auto Scaling
-   S3 for static content
-   Health checks enabled

2)  How to implement blue-green deployment using Route 53? Answer:

-   Use weighted routing
-   Shift traffic gradually
-   Monitor metrics
-   Rollback by adjusting weights

3)  During DDoS attack, how do Route 53 and CloudFront help? Answer:

-   Route 53 is globally distributed DNS
-   CloudFront absorbs traffic at edge
-   Use AWS Shield + WAF
-   Rate limiting rules
